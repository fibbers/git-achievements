Git-Achievements records all of the achievements you acquire while using Git.

There are over 40 achievement, most with different levels to be achieved.
After a git command is executed if a new achievement is unlocked
git-achievements will display a message on the console for your enjoyment:

********************************************************************************
                            Git Achievement Unlocked!                            

                                    Caretaker                                    
                    Added a .gitignore file to a repository.

GitHub Pages
------------

A log of all of your achievements is kept locally, but you can also publish
it to GitHub pages so you can share your achievements (and there is a rss
feed so people can track your achievements).

For example here is mine: http://icefox.github.com/git-achievements

To push your achievements to GitHub first fork the project on GitHub,
clone *your* repository and set the following config to true:

git config --global achievement.upload "true"

When an achievement is unlocked the index.html file will be overwritten,
committed and then a 'git push origin' will be executed.

To create the output in a different directory you can use the following:
git config --global achievement.output.dir ~/Sites/meeech.github.com 

To rename the files output you can set:
git config --global achievement.output.filename git-stats     

To share your git achievements with multiple clones of your git-achievements
repository (e.g. one clone at work and one clone at home, but sharing progress),
set the logfile to locate inside your cloned repository, e.g.:
git config --global git-achievement.logfile /home/fibbers/git-achievements/.git-achievements

git-achievement will then create 2 files where your progress is kept:
/home/fibbers/git-achievements/.git-achievements-action.log and
/home/fibbers/git-achievements/.git-achievements.log

Which you have to add once to the repo and then each time you publish your
achievements, the progress is also pushed and thus shared between your clones
when you pull from github.


Install
-------
Add git-achievements to your path and alias git to git-achievements

For example add the following to the end of your ~/.bash_profile

export PATH="$PATH:~/git/git-achievements"
alias git="git-achievements"

You can get your first achievement by running

    git achievements --help
